<p>As a company focused on consulting, it is very important that information on the consultants' experience is up to date and readily available for sale and skill development. Often this is been stored in individual Word or even PDF documents and various competency matrices, and it's difficult to reuse, update and keep organized.</p>

<p>ACS is a tool that helps you keep your CVs up to date and ensure your customers always get the freshest CV from any of your employees. </p>

<p>You updated the visual identity of your company? Update one CV template, and all CVs will look fresh and delicious. Do you have sub contractors that require a different CV template? No problem, create a new one, upload it, and you don't have to manually reinput every employees data into a separate document.</p>
